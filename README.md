Scaffolded with react-create-app.
[Read manual here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#syntax-highlighting-in-the-editor)

## Install dependenciues
Use npm 5+.

`npm install`

You also need to have react-create-app installed in your system for this project to work (most likely, didn't try without). 

## Run
`npm run start`

This should start the server and open the project in the browser.

See package.json for other scripts

## VSCode stuff
Install these vscode packages to make your life easier:
- Babel ES6/ES7
- Debugger for chrome
- ESLint
- Flow language support
- Jest
- Prettier - Javascript formatter

There are ready-made configs for vscode in the project, so nothing needs to be configured separately.
You can use another editor, but set up relevant ESLint, Flow, and Prettier extensions, and make sure they work with the project. It will save a lot of pain. 

## How to use Flow and typing
Typing (with types) is good for you and everyone, it reduces bugs, makes code more robust, and improves its self-documentation. Do types!

Check out official [instructions](https://flow.org/en/docs/react/components/) on how it works and how you use it. 

Read [this article](https://medium.com/flow-type/even-better-support-for-react-in-flow-25b0a3485627) about the latest changes for React, especially if you try to learn from not-so-recent tutorials.
